## How to get it

Android? Download the latest APK here: [releases][]

iOS? If you're jailbroken, you can download the IPA from the latest release and
should be able to install it on your device with [AppSync Unified][].

[releases]: https://github.com/perlatus/e1547/releases
[AppSync Unified]: https://cydia.angelxwind.net/?page/net.angelxwind.appsyncunified

Otherwise, to get e1547 for free, you'll have to compile from source on a mac.
See [How to install on iOS from source][] for instructions.

Alternatively, if you [pledge to the $6 tier on my patreon
campaign][the-generous-apple], I'll register your device for a jailbreak-free
install. I only have a limited number of slots, however, and once they're gone
I can't get more.
