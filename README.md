## Download  

You can download the latest Android apk here: [releases](https://github.com/clragon/e1547/releases/latest)

Unfortunately, I do not own a machine to compile iOS releases with.
You will have to compile it from source on a Mac.

You should be able to compile the app yourself with [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

## Contact
The app is currently under development.  
If you have questions/comments/suggestions, you can open a github Issue.  
You can also post in the [e926 forum thread](https://e926.net/forum_topics/25854).
